github picture comparison demo
=================

just discovered GitHub's awesome picture comparisons functions and wanted to share

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/gekonwi/github_pic_comparison_demo/master/comparison%20functions.png)

if you change a picture (edit it or generate a new version and store it under the same name in the same directory) GitHub offers three different ways to see this change in the commit:

1.  simply have the previous and the current picture verson side by side (default)
2.  a vertical line which can be swiped horizontally to transform the previous version into the new one (called Swipe - my favorite)
3.  a slider which fades between the previous and the current version (called: Onion Skin)

Have a look at [this commit](https://github.com/gekonwi/github_pic_comparison_demo/commit/b1eea75dd0b6837b6662a09304ac605a08fbc632) to see what I mean.
